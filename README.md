### Linking Your Project to Firebase with `serviceAccount.js`

#### 1. Set Up Firebase Project

1. **Create a Firebase Project**
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Click on "Add project" and follow the prompts to create a new Firebase project.

2. **Generate a Service Account Key**
   - In the Firebase Console, navigate to your project.
   - Click on the gear icon next to "Project Overview" and select "Project settings".
   - Go to the "Service accounts" tab.
   - Click on "Generate new private key" and confirm by clicking "Generate key". This will download a JSON file containing your service account credentials.

#### 2. Create `serviceAccount.json`

1. **Create a New File**
   - In your project directory, create a new file named `serviceAccount.json`.

2. **Add the Service Account Credentials**
   - Copy the content of the downloaded JSON file and paste it into `serviceAccount.json`.
   - Export the credentials as a module. Your `serviceAccount.json` should look like this:

   ```javascript
   const serviceAccount = {
     "type": "service_account",
     "project_id": "your-project-id",
     "private_key_id": "your-private-key-id",
     "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR-PRIVATE-KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
     "client_email": "your-client-email@your-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
     "client_id": "your-client-id",
     "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
     "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
   }


## Usage

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

Then to start the backend server go back to parent directory and then.
